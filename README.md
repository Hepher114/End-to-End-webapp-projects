We're developing a web application for a unicorn ride-sharing service named Wild Rydes, inspired by the Amazon workshop. The app leverages AWS services like IAM, Amplify, Cognito, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The code is hosted on GitHub and integrated into a CI/CD pipeline using Amplify.
Users can create an account, log in, and request a ride by selecting a location on an ArcGIS-powered map. The application is designed to be extensible, allowing for additional features to be added.
